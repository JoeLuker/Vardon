      Tengus are a race of wingless avian humanoids with humanoid hands, clawed feet, and a beak that resembles that of a crow or raven. Matching the colors of these birds, most tengus' feathers are jet black; however, a few possess brown or blue-black coloration instead.

      Ranging throughout almost all of the Dragon Empires, tengus have long suffered the scorn and abuse of the ruling humans, treated as a lesser race and relegated to the underclass. The recent fall of Lung Wa has allowed tengus to break free from the tyranny of other races, and the tengu nation of Kwanlai is testament to this achievement. Nonetheless, centuries of poverty and strife have made many tengus covetous of the wealth of other races, and tengus' reputation for thievery, deceit, and secrecy often precedes them wherever they go. While some tengus seek to dismantle such unfair stereotypes, others fit the bill by choice, thinking they may as well commit the crimes they are already so often accused of.

      Tengus possess a rich culture that combines aspects from the numerous societies their people have been a part of, though they are loath to share the more unique parts of their own culture with outsiders, as they are largely distrustful and scornful of others.

      Physical Description: Oreads are strong and solidly built, with skin and hair colored stony shades of black, brown, gray, or white. While all oreads appear vaguely earthy, a few bear more pronounced signs of their elemental heritageâ€”skin that shines like polished onyx, rocky outcroppings protruding from their flesh, glowing gemstones for eyes, or hair like crystalline spikes. They often dress in earthy tones, wearing practical clothing well suited to vigorous physical activity and preferring fresh flowers, simple gemstones, and other natural accents to complex manufactured jewelry.

      Society: As a minor offshoot of the human race, oreads have no real established society of their own. Instead, most oreads grow up in human communities learning the customs of their parents. Adult oreads have a well-deserved reputation among other races for being hermits and loners. Few take well to the bustle of city life, preferring instead to spend their days in quiet contemplation atop some remote mountain peak or deep below the earth in a secluded cavern. Oreads with a greater tolerance for life among humans often join the city watch, or find some other way to serve their community in a position of responsibility.

      Relations: Oreads feel comfortable in the company of dwarves, with whom they have much in common. They find gnomes too strange and many halflings far too brash, and so avoid these races in general. Oreads gladly associate with half-orcs and half-elves, feeling a sense of kinship with the other part-human races despite inevitable personality conflicts. Among the elemental-touched races, oreads have few friends but no true enemies.

      Alignment and Religion: Oreads are, perhaps above all else, set in their ways, and any disruption of their routine is met with quiet disapproval. Oreads are fiercely protective of their friends, but don't seem particularly concerned with the well-being of those outside their small circle of acquaintances. As such, most oreads are lawful neutral. Religious life comes easily to the earth-touched. They appreciate the quiet, contemplative life of the monastic order, and most dedicate themselves to the worship of earth- or nature-related deities.

      Adventurers: Oreads are initially hesitant adventurers. They dislike leaving their homes and don't handle the shock of new experiences well. Usually it takes some outside force to rouse oreads into action, often by threatening their homes, lives, or friends. Once the initial threat is dealt with, however, oreads often find they've grown accustomed to the adventuring life, and continue to pursue it through the rest of their days. Oreads make good monks and fighters thanks to their prodigious strength and self-discipline.
