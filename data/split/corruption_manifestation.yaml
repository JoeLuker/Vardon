    Gift: You gain Dodge as a bonus feat and a +2 racial bonus on Stealth checks. At manifestation level 6th, you can climb walls (as per spider climb) at will.

    Stain: You can enter a private dwelling only if invited in by someone with the authority to do so, unless you succeed at a DC 30 Will save.
    If you fail, you can never retry the save, but you can enter if you're later invited inside.

- id: &manifestation_fangs_id 115
  name: 'fangs'
  label: 'Fangs'
  corruption_id: *corruption_vampirism_id
  min_manifestation_level: 2
  description: |
    Gift: You can, as a swift action, grow fangs that grant you a bite attack. This is a primary natural attack that deals 1d6 points of piercing damage if your size is Medium (1d4 if Small). You can dismiss the fangs as a move action. You can drain blood with your bite from a helpless creature as a standard action, or a pinned creature as a free action once per round immediately after succeeding at a combat maneuver check to pin the creature or maintain your pin. Each time you drain blood, you deal 1 point of Constitution damage. This counts toward the feeding you must do to avoid your corruption progressing; you needn't entirely drain and kill the creature. Draining blood changes your alignment only if you feed on an unwilling innocent.

    Stain: To avoid a saving throw against your corruption progressing, you must drink the requisite amount of blood each day instead of each week.

  description: |
    Gift: As a standard action a number of times per day equal to 1/2 your manifestation level, you can grant yourself fast healing 1 for 1 minute.

    Stain: While you're in direct sunlight, you become shaken. Nothing can remove this condition, nor does immunity to fear prevent it, but it ends as soon as you are no longer in sunlight.

- id: &manifestation_greater_unlife_id 117
  name: 'greater_unlife'
  label: 'Greater Unlife'
  corruption_id: *corruption_vampirism_id
  min_manifestation_level: 4
  description: |
    Gift: When you use the ability of the unlife manifestation, you gain fast healing 3 instead of fast healing 1. While the fast healing lasts, you are immune to nonlethal damage, ability damage, and ability drain, although you retain any you already had.

    Stain: Whenever you're in direct sunlight, you're staggered instead of shaken. Nothing can remove or prevent this condition, but it ends once you're out of direct sunlight.

- id: &manifestation_true_unlife_id 118
  name: 'true_unlife'
  label: 'True Unlife'
  corruption_id: *corruption_vampirism_id
  min_manifestation_level: 5
  description: |
    Gift: When you're reduced to fewer than 0 hit points but not slain and you have a use of fast healing remaining, you immediately assume gaseous form, activate your fast healing, and remain conscious. Once you have more than 0 hit points, the effect ends. This delays the normal Will save against your corruption progressing until gaseous form ends.

    Stain: If you remain in direct sunlight, at the end of your second turn you burst into flame, taking 1d6 points of fire damage per manifestation level you have each round. This fire damage bypasses resistance or immunity and can't be prevented. The fire damage and staggered condition end as soon as you get out of direct sunlight. If you are reduced to fewer than 0 hit points while in direct sunlight, you are slain and can't be brought back to life without true resurrection.
