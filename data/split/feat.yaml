    When you consume keif, you take 1 fewer point of Constitution or Wisdom damage (your choice). In addition, you add spells from the sahir-afiyun spells listed below to your own class spell list or list of spells known.

    You can add one spell from the highest level you can cast; you can instead add two spells to your list of spells known, but both of these spells must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spell you can cast for that class. If you have more than one spellcasting class, choose one and add the sahir-afiyun spell or spells listed below to that class's spell list or list of spells known.

    1st—alleviate addiction, lesser confusion, night blindness, keif vigor, ray of sickening, remove fear, sleep.
    2nd—augury, calm emotions, euphoric cloud.
    3rd—contact high, deep slumber, imbue with addiction.
    4th—absorbing inhalation, confusion, divination.
    5th—symbol of sleep.

    All sahir-afiyun spells require 1 dose of keif as a material component, either replacing the existing material component, or as part of the material component if the existing component costs more.

    Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, add one or more sahir-afiyun spells to your spell list.
